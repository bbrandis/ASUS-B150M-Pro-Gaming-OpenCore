# ASUS B150M Pro Gaming OpenCore
```
- This is an archive of my OpenCore 0.5.8 configuration from early 2024 for my ASUS B150 system. 

- This is not a drop-in replacement, and I do not recommend using it as-is.

- This config should only be used to help with troubleshooting, or help you get off the ground.

Here is a list of the hardware for which this config was made.

Board: ASUS B150M Pro Gaming
Graphics: Sapphire Nitro OC Radeon RX 560 4GB
Processor: Intel Core i5-7500
Drive: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB NVMe drive
Memory: shouldn't matter much

This config wasn't used with macOS newer than 10.15 Catalina,
so compatibility with macOS 11.0+ is unknown.

This config doesn't properly patch USB ports, and uses USBInjectAll instead.
